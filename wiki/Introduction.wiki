#summary the introduction page to vb6 to java.

= Introduction =

The goal of this application is to translate Microsoft Visual Basic version 6 code to Java code.

The code related to describe the interface (all the code located in forms before the keyword Attribute) will be ignored by this tool. The tool will translate only Visual Basic code, not interface definition code.

The resulting code is not supposed to be ready to compile. The application tries to help the programmer to translate the 90% of the code. The programmer has to translate the harder parts.

= How to Use =

Download the last compiled version from 

http://code.google.com/p/vb6-to-java/downloads/list 

or download the code from 

http://code.google.com/p/vb6-to-java/source/checkout

After downloading the compiled version which is a zip, you will need to extract all the files to a folder in your system. Run the file run.bat to start the program.

When the login window appears press the Ok button. Then choose a vbp or vbg file to start translating your projects.
